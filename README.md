# Project_explanation
hi,
  myself Abhishek kumar, i created that address book application ,here there is brief description about my knowledge in python as i like to work on python.
  here i provided basic fiels , where user can create their records(name,country_name,email,phone_number,location) and user can also update their records, if     any changes they want, do it very easily. also, user can also delete their record by simply type their id and datas are also delete from database. address 
  contains co-ordinates. so, the API users can also be able to retrive the address by address co-ordinates.
  technology:-
  here, i used FAST API, python 3.10, sqlite database , and used pydantic library(to validate the fields). also , datas are showing in swagger ui , provided by   FAST API. i used auto-increament for id, so datas are arranged in a well manner, each user can get their records so easily by putting their unique id.
